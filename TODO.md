# List of things to do in this API

- [x] Add update and delete routes
- [x] Setup a docker to run psql
- [ ] Migrate over to running with psql instead of sqlite
- [ ] Leverage viper or godotenv to load in relevant config (which will also be in docker compose)
- [ ] Leverage gin-jwt middleware (look at using argon2id for hashing? and ES256 algo)
- [ ] Look into auth opportunities (see above)
